	<h1> StarCraft Esports </h1>
	<p>I've had a huge interest in StarCraft Esports for at least the last 7 years. It has a long and storied history, particularly in South Korea where it is the 2nd most played game today, despite getting into it's 26th year after release. The game was one of the first and very few very responsive Real-Time Strategy (RTS) games. In 2017, it also had an HD update which helped bring back large audiences after a hiatus when it's sequel, Starcraft II was released in 2010.</p>
	
	<p>One of the first big events was the <a href="https://liquipedia.net/starcraft/1999_Sports_Seoul_Cup">1999 Sports Seoul Cup</a> which was originally held between some of the best players on the online ladder, but soon led to leagues being setup like the <a href="https://liquipedia.net/starcraft/OnGameNet_Starleague">OnGameNet Starleague</a> which continued for 13 years and had over $2 million in prizes, leading to huge names in Korea, games being shown on live TV and even huge venues where over <a href="https://www.espn.co.uk/esports/story/_/id/20184985/starcraft-beaches-busan-awash-esports-history">100k people reportedly packed onto a beach to watch a final unfold.</a></p>
	
	<p>Some of the most notable players (by their in-game names) include:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>BoxeR</li>
		<li>Flash</li>
		<li>Jaedong</li>
		<li>NaDa</li>
	</ul>
